                <p>
                    My main source of inspiration were Art Nouveau letterforms and wood block letters. I really like the way many Art Nouveau typefaces have those inward curving strokes and that was something I was interesting in adding to my typeface. I also wanted something sturdy and a bit blocky because I knew the limitations of CSS and since my plan was to work with moving CSS shapes around, I wanted to make the process as easy as possible since it would be time-consuming. I moved on to some tests and sketches and tried to incorporate both of these ideas in my typeface.

                <h2>Sketch</h2>
                <p>
                    I took the ideas of inward curving letters and the rough, handmade, blocky feel of wood block lettering and sketched out the below bubble-esque typeface. I had planned to use CSS Shapes to make my letters but I decided to sketch out my letters using a grid just in case I needed to switch to CSS grids if I struggled with moving around the shapes. Using grids in my sketch also helped me keep track of stroke weight, width and height of my letterforms.

                <h2>Draft 1 Letters</h2>
                <p>
                    After I had my sketch I started drafting my letters. I started with "A" and immediately realized how long this would take. I created each shape, changed the border radius, the width and height, and set it to position: absolute and moved each section individually. Each letter has 3-8 or so shapes in it and so it was a very, VERY time-consuming process. I stuck with it though, even though it would have been easier to use a grid, because I really liked the chunky, handmade look of my letters. As I went on, the Art Nouveau ideas I wanted to include kind of faded because of the thickness of the letters, but the condensed look and some of the curves, like in the "A" and "N", still include some Art Nouveau influence.

                <h2>Final Typeface</h2>
                <p>
                    After the critique of my first draft I made a few changes to my tyeface. My critiques were about things like white space, width, a few specific letter changes, and every letter being the same width. I made those changes and I also made my letters more rounded as in my previous version some corners were fairly sharp in contrast to other corners being curved, and I wanted a more bubble-letter, rounded look. I also added colour just to improve the presentation a bit. I had wanted to add interactivity or animations to my letters but due to time constraints I didn't end up achieving that. Since each letter is made up of shapes, it was tougher to animate, but I do wish I had added some simple animations. I think if I were to continue working on it that would be my next step, as well as maybe adding numbers or turning it into a more usable typeface.
